# Forest_Fire_Classification
#### Google Developer Student Club UIN Syarif Hidayatullah Jakarta (Intermediate Machine Learning Class)

This project is the final assignment of GDSC UIN Jakarta for the intermediate machine learning class.
In this project I classify using an artificial neural network for a forest fire dataset.
Classification tries to compare performance for the cases of binary classification, multi-class classification and regression.

#### Forest Fires
Donated on 2/28/2008
This is a difficult regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data (see details at: http://www.dsi.uminho.pt/~pcortez/forestfires).

Additional Information

In [Cortez and Morais, 2007], the output 'area' was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function.
   Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were
   post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were
   used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two
   regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed
   with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value:
   12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The
   best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve
   (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect,
   the SVM model predicts better small fires, which are the majority.
